## Luxor

Luxor provides basic vector drawing functions, and utilities for working with shapes, polygons, clipping masks, PNG images, and turtle graphics. The focus of Luxor is on simplicity: it should be easier to use than plain  [Cairo.jl](https://github.com/JuliaLang/Cairo.jl), with shorter names, fewer underscores, default contexts, and simplified functions.
