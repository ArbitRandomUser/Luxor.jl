## Luxor

Luxor provides basic vector drawing functions, and utilities for working with shapes, polygons, clipping masks, PNG images, and turtle graphics.

The focus of Luxor is on simplicity: it should be easier to use than [Cairo.jl](https://github.com/JuliaLang/Cairo.jl), with shorter names, fewer underscores, default contexts, and simplified functions. It's for when you just want to draw something without too much ceremony.

[Colors.jl](https://github.com/JuliaGraphics/Colors.jl) provides excellent color definitions and is also required.
