# Introduction to Luxor

Luxor provides basic vector drawing functions and utilities for working with shapes, polygons, clipping masks, PNG images, and turtle graphics. It's intended to be an easy interface to [Cairo.jl](https://github.com/JuliaLang/Cairo.jl).

Please submit issues and pull requests.
